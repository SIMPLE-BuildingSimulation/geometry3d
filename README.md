This library has several 3D Geometry functionalities. E.g.,

* Points
* Vectors
* Segments
* Transforms
* Triangles
* Triangulation (e.g., sort of meshing... but not very high quality for finite element methods, probably)
* Polygons
* Ray/Primitive intersection algorythms (not fast enough for rendering, though, as it uses dynamic dispatch)
