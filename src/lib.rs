//! This library has several 3D Geometry functionalities. E.g.,
//!
//! * Points
//! * Vectors
//! * Segments
//! * Transforms
//! * Triangles
//! * Triangulation (e.g., sort of meshing... but not very high quality for finite element methods, probably)
//! * Polygons
//! * Ray/Primitive intersection algorythms (not fast enough for rendering, though, as it uses dynamic dispatch)

// Define whether we are working with
// doubles (i.e., f64) or floats (i.e., f32)

/// The kind of Floating point number used in the
/// library... the `"float"` feature means it becomes `f32`
/// and `f64` is used otherwise.

#[cfg(not(feature = "float"))]
